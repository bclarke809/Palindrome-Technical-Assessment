# Palindrome-Technical-Assessment

Define:
A Palindrorme is any set of words and numbers that can be read the same forwards and backwards. A palindrome does NOT include any special characters such as "!,.?[]..."

The Code:
There are 3 files used for this code; main.cpp, TestLib.cpp and TesTLib.hpp. TestLib.cpp is used to hold certain functions that are not in the main code, including the Unit Test scenarios. The hpp file is used to link all cpp files, and also includes external variables that can be used across files. The main.cpp file is the basis for the code, where the user will select whether to run unit tests, or use a custom input when running the program.

If the user wishes to add any unit tests, please ensure you add a case to both functions (UnitTests and TestResults) using the same case number. User must also go to function Palindrome_Unit_Tests in main.cpp and change the value for the while loop, so that new unit tests are executed.
